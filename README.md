### Prerequisites

The program requires:
- Go 1.19
- SQLite 3
- Gin (see built using to find link to installation)

### Example Requests

Example of get request in python:

```python
import requests

x = requests.get("http://localhost:8080/users")

print(x.text)
print(x.status_code)
```

```python
import requests

x = requests.post("http://localhost:8080/users", json = {"id": "0", "name": "Zhenghan Zhong", "mail": "eee", "cred": "eee", "token": "eee", "link": ""})

```

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

There are 2 main endpoints in this API both in /users.

The GET request for the /users header will return a json file with all users. The POST request for /users requires a json object to be passed in matching an instance of the go struct user. The properties which need to be passed in are:

- "id", string value but it does not matter as it will be overwritten
- "name", full name of student
- "mail", school mail of student
- "cred", jwt encoded Google API signon credential
- "token", active session token

There is also an optional property "link" representing the profile picture link
